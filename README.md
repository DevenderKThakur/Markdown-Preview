# Markdown Previewer

A simple web-based Markdown Previewer that allows users to enter Markdown text in a textarea and see the formatted output in real time. The application uses `marked.js` for Markdown parsing and `highlight.js` for syntax highlighting.

## Features

- **Real-time Markdown Preview:** Updates the preview section as the user types.
- **Basic Markdown Support:** Supports headings, bold, italics, links, and lists.
- **Code Blocks with Syntax Highlighting:** Uses `highlight.js` to style code snippets.
- **Dark Mode UI:** Provides a visually appealing dark mode design.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes for better usability.
- **Clear Button:** Allows users to reset the input and preview.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML** - Structure of the application
- **CSS** - Styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript** - Handling Markdown parsing and user interactions
- **Marked.js** - Parsing Markdown syntax

## Installation and Usage

## Responsive Design
